# Qwen2.5-7B

## Introduction

Qwen2.5 is the latest series of Qwen large language models. For Qwen2.5, we release a number of base language models and instruction-tuned language models ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters. Qwen2.5 brings the following improvements upon Qwen2:

- Significantly **more knowledge** and has greatly improved capabilities in **coding** and **mathematics**, thanks to our specialized expert models in these domains.
- Significant improvements in **instruction following**, **generating long texts** (over 8K tokens), **understanding structured data** (e.g, tables), and **generating structured outputs** especially JSON. **More resilient to the diversity of system prompts**, enhancing role-play implementation and condition-setting for chatbots.
- **Long-context Support** up to 128K tokens and can generate up to 8K tokens.
- **Multilingual support** for over 29 languages, including Chinese, English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai, Arabic, and more. 

**This repo contains the base 7B Qwen2.5 model**, which has the following features:
- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining
- Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
- Number of Parameters: 7.61B
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 6.53B
- Number of Layers: 28
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 28 for Q and 4 for KV
- Context Length: 131,072 tokens

**We do not recommend using base language models for conversations.** Instead, you can apply post-training, e.g., SFT, RLHF, continued pretraining, etc., on this model.

For more details, please refer to our [blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/), [GitHub](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), and [Documentation](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Requirements

The code of Qwen2.5 has been in the latest Hugging face `transformers` and we advise you to use the latest version of `transformers`.

With `transformers<4.37.0`, you will encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2'
```

## Evaluation & Performance

Detailed evaluation results are reported in this [ðŸ“‘ blog](https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5/).

For requirements on GPU memory and the respective throughput, see results [here](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/benchmark/speed_benchmark.html).
